Pterminal
=========

This simulates a terminal form fallout in HTML 5

not completely identical, but similar enough for playing around with.


Feautres to add:

* Display correct cursor, ie not dot but block and flashy
* Display cursor/slow write on the choose screen and the final screens
* IP ban on failure? :)
